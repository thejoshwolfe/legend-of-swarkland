# Legend of Swarkland

## Status

Basic turn-based, hack-n-slash survival game.

## How Do I Run It?

### Windows

[Latest Windows Build](http://superjoe.s3.amazonaws.com/temp/legend-of-swarkland.html)

### Ubuntu

add ppa for rucksack:

```
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:andrewrk/rucksack
sudo apt-get update
```

install dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get install librucksack-dev rucksack libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libpng12-dev upx-ucl
```

build:

```
make
```

run:

```
./build/native/legend-of-swarkland
```

run with gdb from the command line:

```
gdb -iex "add-auto-load-safe-path ./" -ex run -ex quit ./build/native/legend-of-swarkland
```

## Build for Windows on Linux

 0. `git clone https://github.com/mxe/mxe`
 0. Follow these instructions: http://mxe.cc/#requirements-debian
 0. In the mxe directory: `make gcc sdl2 sdl2_ttf libpng rucksack`
 0. In legend-of-swarkland directory: `make MXE_HOME=/path/to/mxe windows`

(You can build for both Windows and native Linux at the same time by appending `native` to the above.)

See [this project](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/www.legend-of-swarkland) for
source code to the website.

## Eclipse Environment Setup on Linux

Josh develops this project in Eclipse on Linux, but of course it's optional.
These instructions were last updated with Eclipse Mars.

Search Google for "eclipse download" to get to the right Eclipse downloads page (there are lots of wrong download pages.).
You should see several options such as "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers".
Get "Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers".
You should get a binary archive on the order of 200MB with an executable at the top level called `eclipse`.

In my experience, the Eclipse Installer utility sucks.
It selected a slow mirror from another country,
took 20 minutes to download stuff into the /tmp directory,
crashed with a "Widget is disposed" error,
deleted its download cache,
and didn't save any of my install path preferences for the next attempt.
Worthless.

```
sudo apt-get install default-jdk
```

In eclipse, File -> New -> Project... -> C/C++ -> Makefile Project with Existing Code.
Browse to this directory.
**Click the "Linux GCC" toolchain.**

Now you should be able to open `main.cpp` and see no error or warning annotations.
You should be able to select a system include (`#include <...>`), and F3 to see its source.

### Optional Tweaks

Project -> Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Behavior Tab.
Uncheck "Stop on first build error".
Check "Enable parallel build".
Check "Build on resource save (Auto build)".
Blank out the textboxes under "Make build target" that say "all".

Run -> Debug Configurations... -> C/C++ Application -> New launch configuration.
Main Tab: Project -> Browse... -> select the one.
C/C++ Application: `build/native/legend-of-swarkland`
Debugger Tab: Uncheck "Stop on startup at".
GDB command file: `${workspace_loc:legend-of-swarkland}/.gdbinit`

Project -> Properties -> C/C++ General -> Formatter -> Edit...
Indentation Tab: Indentation policy: Spaces only.
Check "Statements within a 'switch' body".
Line Wrapping Tab: Maximum line width: 9999.
Default indentation for wrapped lines: 1.

## VIM syntax setup

To get vim syntax highlighting for the .swarkland file format:

```
ln -s /path/to/legend-of-swarkland/vim/syntax/swarkland.vim ~/.vim/syntax/swarkland.vim
```

and add this to your `.vimrc`:

```
autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.swarkland set filetype=swarkland
```
